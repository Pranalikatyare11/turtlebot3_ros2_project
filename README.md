# TurtleBot3 ROS2 Project

This project integrates the **TurtleBot3** robot with the **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System 2) framework. It aims to provide a flexible and scalable foundation for various robotic applications using TurtleBot3 with ROS2, leveraging the new features and improvements of ROS 2 over its predecessor ROS 1.

The TurtleBot3 is an affordable, open-source robot designed for research, education, and hobbyist use. By using ROS 2, this project ensures compatibility with modern ROS-based robot programming paradigms and enhanced real-time capabilities.

## Features of the Project

- **Basic Robot Control**: Enables basic robot movement such as navigation, teleoperation, and sensor integration.
- **Simulation with Gazebo**: Allows simulation of TurtleBot3 in the Gazebo environment for testing and development.
- **Navigation Stack**: Leverages ROS 2 navigation stack for autonomous movement, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Sensor Integration**: Integrates sensors like LiDAR, IMU, and cameras for environmental perception and mapping.
- **Teleoperation**: Allows you to control the TurtleBot3 remotely via a keyboard or joystick using ROS 2 teleoperation packages.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **ROS 2**: Any of the supported versions of ROS 2 (Foxy, Galactic, or Humble) should be installed on your machine. ROS 2 is the foundation for building robotic applications and allows for real-time communication between nodes.
- **TurtleBot3 Packages**: The official TurtleBot3 packages for ROS 2 should be installed. These include drivers, controllers, launch files, and configurations.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure any additional dependencies specific to your setup or required for particular functionality are installed. Some of these might include packages for control systems, sensors, and visualization tools.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranalikatyare11/turtlebot3_ros2_project.git
